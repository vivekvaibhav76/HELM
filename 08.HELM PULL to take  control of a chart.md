<h1>HELM PULL</h1>

First unjinstall the existing charts

```sh
helm uninstall monitoring
kubectl get po
```
Create a directory

```
mkdir my-cluster-config
cd my-cluster-config
```

helm pull previously  called as helm fetch

helm pull [chart URL | repo/chartname] [...] [flags]

```sh
helm pull prom-repo/kube-promehteus-stack --untar=true
```

--untar will unpack the chart after downloading it.

```sh
helm install monitoring ./kube-prometheus-stack/
```

After installing all the monitoring stack, now you'll be having the files and folders like
1.templates
2.Chart.yaml
3.values.yaml
4.Charts
etc

Now add the myvalues.yaml file where we are adding the below lines

```sh
grafana:
  adminPassword: admin
  service:
    type: NodePort
    nodePort: 30001
```
After the pasting myvalues.yaml file now the upgrade the 

```sh
helm upgrade monitoring --values=myvalues.yaml .
```
 where the . indicates the path in our case its the current directory.
